📝 What I Did

1. Created a simple webpage layout using HTML.


2. Designed the desktop layout with two columns and a navigation bar.


3. Added a media query for max-width: 768px to make the layout mobile-friendly.


4. Made these responsive changes:

Navigation links stack vertically on mobile

Two columns change to a single-column layout

Font sizes and spacing adjust for small screens

Images scale properly without overflow



5. Tested the design in Chrome DevTools → Mobile View.


6. Ensured no horizontal scrolling or content overflow.

📱 Responsive Behavior (Mobile View)

When the screen width is 768px or smaller:

Navbar items display as blocks (vertical)

Layout stacks vertically for better readability

Header text reduces slightly

Images scale within the container

No overflow or unwanted scrolling
